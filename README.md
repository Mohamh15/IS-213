# IS-213
#Room Booking UIA
This is an open source system for managing room reservations at UIA. There are several campus buildings with different equpment and sizes. Our goal is to optimise the bookings system for students by having a "live update" where useres can see witch rooms are available.

#Motivation
This project is a part of a course at UIA (IS-213). We are students here and have experienced some trouble with the current booking system and have some ideas for improvenent. A lot of rooms are booked although not in use as well as the system itself is kind of cumbersome. We are using QR-codes as a easy and cheap way to address this.
