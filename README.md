# IS-213
#Room Booking UIA
This is an open source project for managing room reservations (focusing currently on only our school which is the University of Agder in Kristiansand, Norway). There are several campus buildings with different equipment and room sizes. Our goal is to optimise the booking system for students by having a way to see whether a room is being used or not making it easier to see which rooms are available. The project is currently a work in progress and is in no way finished. This being an MIT licenced project it is open to the public where

#Motivation

This project is a part of a course at UIA (IS-213). We are students here and have experienced some trouble with the current booking system and have some ideas for improvenent. A lot of rooms are booked although not in use as well as the system itself is kind of cumbersome. We are using QR-codes as a easy and cheap way to address this.

#Installation

In order to get started and help us out in this project certain steps need to be taken to get the program up and running on your computer. Currently, this project is only developed on Xcode and Windows integration has not been implemented as of this moment. 
This project was written within Xcode version 8.3.2 and using the Swift 3 language, please try to use these versions as they are guaranteed to be compatible with the code available on GitHub, older and or eventual newer versions may have different results, so we recommend sticking to Xcode 8.3.2 and Swift 3.
The first step is to download Xcode onto your machine, this can be done by the following steps: 

1.	Open the App Store app on your Mac (by default it’s in the Dock).
2.	In the search field in the top-right corner, type Xcode and press the Return key.
3.	The Xcode app shows up as the first search result.
4.	Click Get and then click Install App.
5.	Enter your Apple ID and password when prompted.
6.	Xcode is downloaded into your /Applications directory. (Apple, 2017)
